Intro
=====

This project gives a very basic example of a Python app on Google App Engine. Download the SDK to run this. If you make any changes to `public/js/contacts.js`, run [pakmanager](https://github.com/coolaj86/node-pakmanager) in the js directory. If you need extra dependencies, add those to it's package.json and build again.

The features this example uses include:

* interacting with a database
* user login (using a provider)
* rest-style routing using App Engine's API

For more information about App Engine, check out [Google's App Engine developer site](https://developers.google.com/appengine/).
